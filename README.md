# A project for Brand Journalists

The object of this project was to provide a themed web page based on a provided mock PSD file.
Wordpress access was given, as well as FTP to the stage website.

## LESS
I used LESS files with the LESS watcher in my PhpStorm IDE and learned much about the do's and don't of LESS.

This project is located at [http://closfactfran.wpengine.com/](http://closfactfran.wpengine.com/) but may have been removed by the time you read this.


### What I would do differently
In the `home.php` template, I would have created posts with a defined category in wordpress to populate the section with the blue balls and links to the posts themselves instead of hard-coding that section.
